Live App: https://checkers-43176.web.app/

# Description

!Checkers is a modern adaptation of the classic board game Checkers aka Draughts aka Dama. 

The game rules allow users to move their !Checkers in both directions from the start i.e reflecting the traditional rules of "Kings" in checkers. This allows users to perform interesting capture moves from the start. 

The game was designed by Pedram Valiani, Nikos Theodoropolous, Osian Muthu-Edwards and Nargis Salim in a timeframe of 1 week and is being actively maintained and updated with new functionality - watch this space. 

# Game Modes
